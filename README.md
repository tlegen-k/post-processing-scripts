# Post-processing scripts
This folder contains Python, Shell and Paraview scripts I used for the automatic post-processing of OpenFOAM simulations results.

## Python
There are two types of code written and used:
1. Using Paraview's API for visualization and data extractions of simulation files. (~10<sup>7</sup> number points)
2. Using Matplotlib to create nice figures with the data extracted.
